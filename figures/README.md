## 🔄 Regeneration

**Note**: These figures are generated automatically when you run `source("final.R")`. 
The actual PNG files are not stored in git due to their size and dynamic nature.

To regenerate these figures:
1. Ensure your data file is in place
2. Run `source("final.R")`
3. Check this directory for new visualizations

## 🎯 Figure Descriptions

### Figure 1: Binary Check Agreement
Shows Cohen's κ agreement between LLMs and manual assessment for Yes/No questions with 95% confidence intervals.

### Figure 2: Ordinal Check Agreement  
Displays linear-weighted κ for 3-level assessments (No/Some/Serious concerns) with agreement thresholds.

### Figure 3: Effect Size Analysis
Presents Cramér's V effect sizes showing association strength between LLM predictions and manual assessment.

### Figure 5: Sample Characteristics
Overview of trustworthiness issues found in the 22 RCT studies (baseline data).

### Figure 6A & 6B: Sample Assessment Patterns
Panel A shows manual gold standard prevalence, Panel B shows LLM agreement performance across assessment types.
